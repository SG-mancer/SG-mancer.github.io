2. **The scholarship of teaching and learning**	Concerned with advancing the understanding and practice of teaching and learning processes.
3. **The scholarship of integration**	Focuses on connecting and synthesizing ideas across disciplines or within a discipline.
4. **The scholarship of application** *(aka the scholarship of engagement)*	Emphasizes the practical application of knowledge to address real-world problems or issues.
