# Design and Technology project ideas #

Here are 4 Project ideas I had when recently compling an assignment to create a scope and sequence for Stage 5 Design and Technology.
They are not too detailed, but could be the start of some engaging and relevant design and technology projects and units for Year 9/10 students.

## Reconstruccting recording from a sport ##

### Content / Focus area ###

- ICT / 3D modeling
- ICT / multimedia.

### Notes ###

Sports cameras have GPS and other telemetry data collected. Also for many sports, the participant is using other technology that is collecting data - for example heart rate monitor when jogging or cycling.
Students could explore reconstructing data from a bike journey, jog, or maybe even paragliding, go-carting, surfing or paddling.

Extract the GPS data, and other data from the recording.
Use a mapping tool, or 3D model to show where the activity occured.
Chart the information, i.e. show the spped, distance, heart rate, altitude, score etc. - use animated charts, to show the change over time.
Combine the video, with overlays and the 3D models to reconstruct the event.

### Design brief ideas ###

Package the design situation, or brief to be about creating a reconstruction to allow analysis of the event, show what occured during it, or just sell how much fun was experienced.
Could be extended to ask students to synch the video with a music track.
Videos and telemetry should be provided - or could be captured at a school camp/excursion? or ask students to provide their own recordings (lend equipment for weekend?)

## Surf board ##

### Content / Focus area ###

* Engineering Systems / transport
* Engineering Systems / bouyancy
* Material Technologies / polymers
* Material Technologies / fibers

### Notes ###

There is a fair bit of technology, and design needed for shaping a surf board.
This could also be designing a foil, or a wing for wing boarding.

Students would need to design shape, consider weight, stability etc.
Surf boards would be made of foam, or similiar polymer, then shape it, apply sealants, and fixtures, possibly use injection moulding techniques, or 3D printing for components and sections.
This would require A LOT OF ROOM, PPE and dust extraction.
Possibly could be done using CNC.

Paint the room (blue, or green) and light it from bottom / top to assist in the shaping process.

### Design breif ideas ###

Simple - make a board.
Difficult - make a floating platform to ride waves... (or some other abstraction of what a surf board is, so a surf board is an option - not the design)

### Resources to support: ###

* [Video about hand shaping board](https://youtu.be/p8k2YyX93v4?si=uubmg-PYws2KC_nU)
* [Beginner's Guide to shaping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB29UIM4spk) - note hand held plane probably not usable by students...
* [Another video about shaping by hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7vi3kDzblE)
* [A more modern approach with CAD/CAM of shaping board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SW0LY0Dcow)


## Sprunki mod ##

### Content / Focus area ###

* ICT / Multimedia
* Digital / Software solution

### Notes ###

Modify incredibox or Sprunki.
This would involve editing the code, adding samples, or triggering other programming to expand and improve the program.

Could similarlyfocus on modifying other open source games.

Allows focus on IP, remix, and open source concepts.

Learn and use many skills, including image and sound editing/manipulation, as well as programming and design process.

### Design breif ideas ###

Could give a mission, i.e. modify game to demonstrate you and your friend's (lack of) music tallent?

Imagine a "designer band" and create them using Sprunki - find drum loops etc. to be the member's sounds.

## One page game ##

### Content / Focus area ###
* ICT / Desktop publishing

### Notes ###
Students create a game that fits on a single page. Maybe it is A3 or bigger folded. Or it could be A5 two sided.

Play testing, research, 
Students will need to decide on design choices like: layout, instruction words, and themes for the game.

### Design brief idea ###
You could be developing a game for people to play on a flight or bus trip, that can be distributed in the back of the seat pocket.

Could include extra requirements, like the game needs to educate people a little about the destination, or a cause (environmentalism, veganism etc.).
Maybe the game could use a coin, or dice - or be on an erasable card.

Encourage the use of a game machanic metaphor - (i.e. tape deck with play, pause, fast-forward) for gameplay.
