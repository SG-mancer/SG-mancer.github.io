This week I got accepted to a teaching program.
It gives me a little over 30% of course completion, to teach Design and Technology at High School.

There was a bit of work in the application. I had to write about my experiences in a range of contexts:
* using industry knoweldge of the past, present and emerging technologies.
* developing and then communicating a solution.
* using innovation and creativity in my industry.
* ways I ensure design decisions are ethical, responsible and sustainable.

I also needed to write an in depth work history report, to explain my hands-on engineering duties. For this I found my old performance reports (that have a section for my duty statement) then expanded 2-4 paragraphs for each position over the past 10 years.

i.e.
> As a project manager I utilised my management and planning skills to schedule the maintenance activies of tasks for 13 navy workshops on HMAS Perth's midlife upgrade...

## Getting use to feeling like a student ##

To help me feel like a student, and celebrate the start of my education journey I purchased a University Hoodie. Whilst on the university store site I noticed I could order a free onboarding/welcome pack.

So now I have a pair of university themed socks, an orange t-shirt, blue hoodie, pen and wall planner. Looking at them makes me feel proud, and mindful of where I am heading.

## Some things I learnt this week ##

The university has a slogan/philosophy (it is translated from Wiradjuri) "Learn to live well and make this world worth living".

### [Knowledge no longer a monopoly of teachers - teachers help student decipher the knoweldge they gather.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_pIK7ghGw4) ###

### Design thinking is a process to solve problems, similar to the scientific method ###
In D&T I will be teaching students the design process (building on what they learnt in other classes), so they have the skills to solve problems.

> I have downloaded the Stage 4 and 5 (Yr 7 -10) curriculum outlines, but not yet reviewed them.

### [Pedagogy starts with frustration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcpwEoW1uY8&feature=youtu.be) ###
There are four learning theories
* Behavourism - late 19th century idea of filling student minds, giving feedback (preferably imediately) to help students know they are on right track.
* Liberationism - centered around students creating knoweldge (rather than teacher knowing it all), encourages independent thinkers.
* Social constructivism - students chatting in class are learning more, because learning takes place not just in the mind but also in community.
* Connecctivism - developing skills to navigate vast bodies of information. Teachers encourage engagement, guide students to help them develop skills to research and teach themselves.

### [Webinar about Inspiring to educate](https://student.csu.edu.au/workshops-events/careers/festival/education-faculty-panel) ###
* Educators connect students with community and give then access to the world.
* Curriculum is only one part of teaching, you also need to report and conduct professional development.
* Self Reflect after each lesson/dAY - it is important for professional development.
* Collaborate with other teachers, and your students - you are there for their learning

Also turn-off, have a personal life, don't burn yourself out. Teaching is also very physical, you need to be fit to do the job standing for long period, minimum breaks for eating etc. 

### [Podcast about IGCSE and learnings](https://www.cambridge.org/us/education/blog/content_type/podcasts/) ###

This podcast had some interesting quotes:

> ...humans are not born to sit still and stay in silence with no interaction between each other; we work off each other, we get the best from each other.

* So trust children in the classroom to explore their learning together.

There was also a point about parent involvement, and if parents aren't onboard with a childs learning, then the child won't feel much part of the school either.

### Bullying ###
I was also a little interested in how teachers handle bullying.

Interestingly [this ABC article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-16/why-bullied-children-are-reluctant-to-seek-help-from-teachers/8357006) highlights Teachers are untrusted to handle bullying, because pupils feel talking to them is inappropriate, futile or counterproductive.

* Consequences - or punishment for bullies doesn't work. (I also wonder about punishment being used by bullies, to dob in people they target to cause them harm)
* There are a few methods for handling bullying:
    * [Pikas method](https://www.kenrigby.net/11e-Shared-Concern-Method-How-it-Works) / shared concerned - where you meet each person involved with the bullying, and get them to aggree (bullies and victims) to a plan to help rectify the situation. This site has [videos of the method in practice](https://readymade.com.au/method).
    * [Support Group Method](https://www.education.vic.gov.au/about/programs/bullystoppers/Pages/methodsupportgroup.aspx) - where the target asks for help, each member states publically what they will do to improve the situation, then it is monitored. But there is no joint meeting

### First course completed ###
I completed the Child Safety course required by the uni. It reinforced the way to respond to a disclosure (listen, avoid leading questions and try be objective).
More importantly it kept reminding us: **Mandatory reporters do not investigate cases of child sexual abuse. The reporter's job is to check if the disclosure has reasonable grounds for suspicion - and if it does report it to professional agenies (who then assess if investigation is warranted).**.
