I remember in technology, maybe it was drawing class we looked at or talked about a game someone had made in D&T. 

Trading cards would be a good design project.

There are lots of aspects of trading card games.

From how the information is presented on the cards.
What ratio is used for cards, or if cards are random, or super rare. Alternatively a Living Trading Card game system could be used, where there are no random cards, just sets.

What are the stories on thec cards:

Students could have friends as enemies and allies.

Or, the cards could be personifications of buildings or companies like these [trading cards](https://youtu.be/-WYuD129dgo?t=696&si=x9v3Hlqyx6brg_sH) at a Shimbashi store.

Students could make a sixth colour for Magic the gathering, or their favourite TCG.
Or make a game that has a novel concept - (maybe lots of 6s that turn into 9 if you spin the card around...)

Marketing - how would they plan to distribute the cards. What is it that users/customers want, need, expect?

## Tools and techniques ##

* Using image software
* Macros to get standard layouts
* Integrate with databases, or tables to compare card costs etc. (there are lots of statistics in TCGs).
* Select unique ways to produce the varying quantities of cards - maybe one rare sheet after 10 common sheets, or have one rare in middle of sheet surrounded by 4 uncommon, then 8 commons and 12 lands... or similarly 1, 8, 16, 24...)

* Printing sets of cards to A2 or A1 stock. 
* Cutting - maybe use laser cutter to get nice rounded corners etc.

* Integrating other technology, i.e. screen printing, or other technology to get raised boarders, or printing layers of colour to get aesthetic of old school comic books etc.
