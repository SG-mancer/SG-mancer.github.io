# ALARM #
## A Learning And Responding Matrix ##

The ALARM tool is designed to helps students to move beyond just learning subject content, by giving them a way to make inquiries that support higher order thinking and demonstrate deeper understanding through their compositions ([Castle Hill High School, 2014](https://castlehill-h.schools.nsw.gov.au/news/2014/7/alarm-a-learning-and-responding-matrix.html)). ALARM can be used both as a self-assessment tool, and communication summary to assist students identify if their composition includes required details to meet the standard expected. The way these tools and reminders were presented for students, in short sentences, examples and clear tables was also beneficial.
